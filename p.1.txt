SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
*nft* [ *-n*Nscae ] [ *-I* 'directory' ] [ *-f* 'filename' | *-i* | 'cmd'...]
*nft* [ *-h* | *--help* ] 
*nft* [ *-v* | *--version* ]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
nft is the command line tool used to set up, maintain and inspect pack‐
et filtering and classification rules in the Linux kernel, in the nfta‐
bles framework.  The Linux kernel subsystem is known as nf_tables,  and
'nf' stands for Netfilter.

OPTIONS
-------
For a full summary of options, run *nft --help*.

*-h*::
*--help*::
	Show help message and all options.

*-v*::
*--version*::
	Show version.

*-n*::
*--numeric*::
	Show data numerically. When used once (the default behaviour), skip
	lookup of addresses to symbolic names. Use twice to also show Internet
	services (port numbers) numerically. Use three times to also show
	protocols and UIDs/GIDs numerically.

*-s*::
*--stateless*::
	Omit stateful information of rules and stateful objects.

*-l*::
*--literal*::
	Translate numeric to literal. When used once (the default behav‐
	iour),  print  services (instead of numerical port numbers). Use
	twice to perform the IP address to name lookup, this usually re‐
	quires  network traffic for DNS lookup that slows down the rule‐
	set listing.

*-c*::
*--check*::
	Check commands validity without actually applying the changes.

*-N*::
*--reversedns*::
	Translate IP addresses to names. Usually requires network traffic for
	DNS lookup.
